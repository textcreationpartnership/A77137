            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170725:8"/>aſſiſtance of his bleſſed Spirit to perform conſtantly our duties in our ſeveral places, that his and our <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> may be made a praiſe in the earth. But if our adverſaries, &amp; the adverſaries of the Goſpel ſhould prevail againſt us, &amp; all ſhould be taken away (though they cannot take Chriſt away nor Heaven away,) Let us labour to live by Faith, and depend upon God, who hath provided for many of us, when we had loſt all, preſerved our lives, when we were in eminent dangers, and will preſerve us to his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom. In the mean time, Honoured and Reverend Brethren, let us labour by wiſdom and power from Chriſt, to fulfil our Miniſtry which we have received from the Lord, to preach the Word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, to Catechiſe and inſtruct our people in the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God, and this both publickly and from houſe to houſe, often to confer with them, and to build them up, and confirm them in the knowledge of Chriſt, that if it pleaſe God they may know the Lord, as the truth is in Jeſus, that they may walke as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, and manifeſt the truth of their Faith, by fruitfulneſſe in all good works; that they and we may by our holy and righteous lives, put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the malevolent ſpirits of all our adverſaries, and <hi>bring forth abundantly like trees of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe the planting of the Lord,</hi> that God may be glorified.

                        <p>Firſt let us look into the Book of God, even from the Creation; read <hi>Geneſ. ch.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. and you ſhall find, That howſoever the Lord the Creator of heaven and earth, the chief Lord of all the world, did and hath entruſted <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and their ſons and daughters, with the keeping and poſſeſſion of inferior creatures and dominion over them, and with the fruits of the earth and the increaſe thereof; yet the Lord hath reſerved a twofold right yet in the creature. Firſt general over all the world and the kingdoms of the earth, and goods therein, to diſpoſe of them when, and where, and to whom he pleaſeth. This the Scripture witneſſeth at full: <hi>He gave the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan to the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15.18. And <hi>Hanna</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, he bringeth low and lifteth up,</hi> 1 Sam. 27.8. And the Pſalmiſt tels us, <hi>The earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> Pſal. 24.1. So the Pſalmiſt again bringeth in God himſelf ſpeaking; <hi>All the beaſts of the forreſt are mine, and ſo are the cattel upon a thouſand hills; and if I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is mine and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> as is expreſſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.10, 12. And the word of the Lord to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> from the Lord: <hi>Thus ſhall ye ſay, I have made the heaven and the earth, the man and the beaſt that are upon the ground by my great power and by my outſtretched arm, and have given it to whomſoever it ſeemed meet unto me. And now I have given all theſe lands into the hands of the king of Babylon my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170725:16"/>ſervant;</hi> as you may find recorded <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.5, 6. This <hi>Daniel</hi> declares in the interpretation of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> dream of the high tree in the midſt of the earth which was decreed to be cut down: The decree was for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himſelf, till he did know that the <hi>Moſt High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will.</hi> Witneſs <hi>Daniel,</hi> ch. 4.25. Thus hath God a general right over all the world and all that is therein</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Again, God hath a ſpecial right in the creature, or part of the creatures and the increaſe of them, which he reſerved for his own proper uſe and ſervice. And this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial right he hath never given away, but hath his ſpecial right ſtill, which he did and hath reſerved in all ages of the world for the outward maintenance of his worſhip and ſervice, and for encouragement and livelihood of his laborers and ſervants whom he calleth and imployeth in his own work, for his own glory, and the good of his Church and children.</p>
                        <p>Firſt the Scripture tells us, that although the Lord gave to our firſt parents the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon the earth, with every herb bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeed, and the fruit of the tree yielding fruit for meat, yet he reſerved ſome part for himſelf for his own ſervice, according to his own will and pleaſure.

And he anſwers the queſtion as in Gods ſtead, It is therefore in Paradiſe, becauſe it is good; but I will not have thee to touch it, becauſe I would have thee obedient. The Lord would have <hi>Adam</hi> know, that he had reſerved the Royalty to himſelf; and that although he gave <hi>Adam</hi> an inheritance in the reſt of the earth and the fruits thereof, to hold to him and to his poſterity upon their good behaviour, yet he ſhould hold it of him as chief Lord; and to touch any part of what God had reſerved for his own ſervice, was no leſs a ſin then Sacrilege it ſelf, and to be puniſhed with death: This was the penalty for the breach of that Divine law, as <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity ſince have found by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                        <p>Again, this forbidden tree in Paradiſe was not all the part of the world which God reſerved for himſelf and his ſervice: For if you read <hi>Gen.</hi>

                        <p>Again, there was a ſecond Tythe of the Nine parts that were tythed before: And this Tythe might not be eaten in any place, as the firſt Tythe which was the Levites portion might, but at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Thus you

                        <p>Thirdly, beſides theſe two Tythes, there was in the place or ſtead of this ſecond Tythe a third Tythe every third year,
<note place="margin">Amos 4.4. <hi>Tythes after three years, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> which was for the Levite, the ſtranger, the fatherleſs and the widow within their gates, as you may read <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.28, 29. This may ceaſe in part as a Tenth, but the ſubſtance is moral.</p>
                        <p>But the firſt Tythe was wholly for the Levites for their maintenance, as the Lords wages or reward the Lord alloweth them for their ſervice in the Sanctuary, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Goſpel, as after will appear. Yea, beſides the Tythes, the Lords portion, the Lord commanded that the Levites ſhould have their Cities to dwell in,
<note place="margin">Num. 35.3 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</note> and the ſuburbs of them ſhall be for their cattel and for their goods, and for all their beaſts; and the ſuburbs of the city ſhall reach from the wall of the city two thouſand cubits round about, <hi>Num</hi> 35. Rich conveniences, beſides
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170725:23"/>extraordinaries, which were very many. This was the Levites lawful gain due unto them by Divine right, by the law of God, and law of Nature, as a reward for their labor in the Lords ſervice. And this gain they might lawfully ſeek after, every one for his gain from his quarter. And this they did, when their juſt portion and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was not brought them by the people.

                           <hi>The Levites went every one to his field for his juſt gain or portion,</hi> as you may find <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.

Hath God releaſed his ſpecial right in the tenth part, the Tythes of all, which were once, yea which are the Lords own, if none can ſhew a better title to them? Let us ſearch the Records in the New Teſtament, and firſt ſee if we can find any ſuch Releaſe or Deed of gift from God and his ſervants, and to whom? Secondly, ſee what is regiſtred for the maintenance and continuance of Gods right unto them. That ſo we may better
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170725:24"/>anſwer the Anabaptiſts, who call Tythes <hi>the wages of unrighteouſneſs;</hi> or the Quakers who accuſe the Miniſters of Chriſt as if they did ſeek for unlawful gain, the gain of Tythes, of that which is neither God's nor theirs, every one for his gain from his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or people.</p>
                        <p>I have ſearched the New Teſtament, and can find Tythes mentioned but only in four places; and in none of theſe doth Chriſt deny, or give away, or releaſe his right to his tenth part, or forbid his Minfſters to receive Tythes; yea rather Tythes are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles that ſpeak of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <label>Firſt place.</label> The firſt place is that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat</hi> 23.23. where he pronounceth that woe againſt the Scribes and Phariſees for their hypocriſie: <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees hypocrites; for ye pay tythe of mint, and anniſe, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: Theſe things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi> It is evident our Saviour doth not reprove them for their paiment of Tythes, but for their omiſſion and neglect of the weightier matters of the Law, judgment, mercy, and ſaith. For he tells them plainly, it was their duty to pay their tythes even of the ſmalleſt things, mint and anniſe, and cummin; theſe things ought not to be left undone. Thus both the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tythes even in the time of Chriſt, and Chriſts approbation of tythes, is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed at full in this place; No prohibition
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170725:25"/>of tythes evidenced, no ceſſation of tythes declared, no denying of Chriſts Miniſters to receive tythes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Again, a ſecond place we find Tythes ſpoken of in the New Teſtament, is that of our Saviour recorded <hi>Luke</hi> 11.42: to the ſame effect with the former, <hi>Woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you Scribes and Phariſees, for ye tythe Mint, and Rue, and all manner of Herbs, and paſs over judgement and the love of God; theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi> You ſee our Saviour in this place alſo approveth of the payment of Tythes, not a word of prohibition or ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but an approbation of the payment of Tythes, as the peoples duty in thoſe days. Had he declared that Tythes ſhould no more be paid after his time, certainly it would have pleaſed many a carnal hearer at that time, as the hopes of that prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ceſſation it is to be feared would pleaſe too many carnal hearted, prophane, or ſpiritually and Antichriſtianly deluded and ſeduced ſouls in theſe days, who would remove both Miniſters and their juſt Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, if it did lie within their power: But you have not a word from Chriſt of ceſſation or taking away of Tythes from the Prieſts of thoſe times, or from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel in ſucceeding ages.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third place in which Tythes are ſpoken of, is that of the ſame Evangeliſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11, 12. <hi>Two men went out into the Temple to pray, the one a Phariſee the other a publican,</hi> the Phariſee gloried in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170725:25"/>
                           <hi>God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this publican; I faſt twice in the week, and give Tythes of all that I poſſeſs:</hi> The Publican humble in his own eyes, <hi>O God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> Our Saviour doth not condemn the Phariſee for his giving of his Tythes of all he did poſſeſs; but for that he truſted in his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as you may ſee evidently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the end why Chriſt did ſpeak the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9. He ſpake this Parable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain that truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others. So that you ſee here is not a word of our Saviour againſt Tythes, or the payment of Tythes in his time, nor a word of prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his Miniſters in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould not receive Tythes; yea, rather Chriſt approveth the payment of Tythes, as part of the Phariſees righteouſneſs which they ought not to leave undone, and he tells his Diſciples, <hi>that exccept their righteouſnſs do exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, they cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Matth: 5.20.
<note place="margin">Origen in Mat.</note> From which <hi>Origen</hi> in his time proſſeth the payment of Tythes in the Goſpel as a duty.</p>
                        <p>The fourth and laſt place in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament where tythes are ſpoken of, is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. in which Chapter tythes are mentioned ſix or ſeven ſeveral times, and in none of theſe are Tythes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Spirit of God in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but rather approved and declared
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170725:26"/>to continue even to the worlds end, as Chriſt's right and ſpecial part for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his ſervice, who is a Prieſt not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of <hi>Aaron</hi> for a time, but a Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec.</hi>

                        <p>To give you a clear light to ſee this truth, read the Chapter, and you ſhall finde that the Apoſtle in the three firſt verſes rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Hiſtory recorded in <hi>Geneſis</hi> of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> deſcribed by his Offices, 1.

                           <hi>Here men that dye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>receive Tythes;</hi> that is, herein in the Prieſts of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Levies</hi> order, they who are mortal receive Tythes; they and their Prieſthood are mortal, and ſo their receiving of Tythes it mortal, as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like themſelves, and their order of Prieſthood is dead and gone, and their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dead as <hi>Levies</hi> Prieſthood ended; But here <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> that Prieſt of the moſt high God, and his order receive tythes, <hi>of whom it is witneſſed that he liveth:</hi> for verſe 3. <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning of days, nor end of life,</hi> and ſo he liveth to receive tythes while the world laſted, not in himſelf but in Chriſt, whom he typified, and <hi>who is a High Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedec,</hi> and ſo to receive Tythes as <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> did, not from any right from <hi>Levi</hi> or the Levitical Law, but in his own right from God his Father, <hi>who made him heir of all,</hi> Heb. 1.2.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Melchiſedec</hi>'s Prieſthood was more excellent then <hi>Aaron</hi>'s or <hi>Levi</hi>'s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Levi</hi> who received tythes, paid tythes in <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> for he was yet in the loyns of his Father his Grandfather <hi>Abraham</hi> when <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> met him, as the Apoſtle declareth,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.9, 10.</note> Verſ 9, 10. But we read not that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> paid tythes at all. It is Chriſt's priviledge to receive tythes, not to pay tythes; therefore <hi>Melchiſedec</hi>'s and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170725:27"/>
                           <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Prieſthood is far more excellent then <hi>Aaron</hi>'s or <hi>Levi</hi>'s Prieſthood or their order.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle taketh another Argument from the Law of Ordination of each Prieſthood, <hi>Melchiſedec</hi>'s and <hi>Aaron's,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s and <hi>Aarons.</hi> This verſ. 15, 16, 17. Becauſe Chriſt <hi>who ariſeth another Prieſt after the order or ſimiltude of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec, he is made not after the Law of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commandment,</hi> the Levitical Law which is ended,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 110.4.</note> 
                           <hi>but after the power of an endleſs life: Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melceiſedec.</hi> Therefore as <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi> did, ſo doth and may Chriſt receive tythes, for they are Gods part, and Chriſt's part as Heir to God his Father, and ſo tythes are rightly, yea, by Divine right due to Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>And thus you ſee there is nothing in the New Teſtament in all theſe places in which tythes are mentioned, by which God the Father may be proved to have given away tythes from Chriſt his Son, the Lord of his Church and of his Servants in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, nor in which Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed his right to any, or diſpoſed of it to any but to his Miniſters for their labor in his ſervice in the Goſpel. Therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the erring <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> or <hi>Quakers</hi> ſpeak to the contrary to their ſeduced Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, Tythes are the Lords ſtill, and will be to the end of the world.</p>

Certainly it is not that Chriſt would take any thing from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that was none of his own, to pay his workmen with; but to teach us, that Chriſt had a part, a portion and inheritance in the peoples hands, the Tythes, the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved part; and out of this his own part Chriſt expected, his Diſciples, his Preachers of the Goſpel ſhould be maintained, and threatens thoſe who ſhould refuſe to give his ſervants entertainment;

                        <p>Thus doth the Apoſtle, though not name tythes, yet require as much in effect as a duty from the people to communicate tythes, or an equal maintenance for and to the Miniſters of Chriſt: And this from the Lords ordinance for the paiment of that certain reward for their labor,

                           </label> It is true, That the Levitical Prieſthood is changed, and that Covenant of <hi>Levi</hi> by Sacrifices and Ceremonies figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſt the Meſſias to come, that is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ended, all being fulfilled in Chriſt; for that Law of <hi>Levies</hi> Prieſthood, in what reſpect it was Typicall,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.1, 2</note> that had but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of good things to come; for it was not poſſible that the Blood of Buls and Goats could ever take away ſin; therefore Chriſt cometh and offers his own body, and by that one offering once for all, he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified;
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note> ſo that theſe Levitical Sacrifices they are all ended by that one ſacrifice of Chriſt. But there were divers things which <hi>Levi</hi> did, which were not typical or figurative cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be ended at the coming or aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, or in the time of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>As firſt, The Levites did ear, and drink, and wear apparel for their bodily nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170725:33"/>and preſervation of the life of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and this was not ceremonial, but nature to be done by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by the poſitive Law of God, for God commanded our firſt parents to eat freely of the trees of the Garden, <hi>Of every tree of the garden thou ſhalt eat freely,</hi> Gen. 2.16. and this was not Levitical nor Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, nor to end at the coming of Chriſt; for Chriſt himſelf commandeth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples when he ſent them abroad to preach the Goſpel, to <hi>eat ſuch things as were ſet before them, Luk.</hi> 10.8. And if theſe actions of <hi>Levi</hi> were ended in Chriſt, then it was unlawful for any man or woman to eat, or drink, or to wear apparel, which is irrational and contrary to the mind of Chriſt, <hi>Lu.</hi> 10.7.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Levites did bleſs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this was another action of theirs <hi>Num.</hi> 6.22, <hi>&amp;c. And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, Speak unto Aaron and his ſons, and ſay unto them, on this wiſe ſhall ye bleſs the children of Iſrael. And the Lord ſeparated the Tribe of Levi to ſtand before the Lord, and to bleſs in his name,</hi> Deut. 10.1. And this was not ceremonial neither, nor to end at Chriſts coming; for Chriſt teacheth his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples to bleſs them that curſe them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. And the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt do bleſs the bread and wine in the Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. And it was the practice of the Church and Miniſters of Chriſt to bleſs or pray for a bleſſing on the corgregation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Levites taught the good
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170725:34"/>knowledge of God, for which that good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpake comfortably to them 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.22. <hi>And they did read in the Book of the Law,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Nehem. 8.8, 9.</note> 
                           <hi>and gave the ſenſe, and cauſed to underſtand the reading,</hi> Nehem. 8. And theſe actions were not ceremonial, nor to be aboliſhed by Chriſt; for Chriſt commands his Diſciples that they ſhould <hi>go and teach all Nations, Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. And thus <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> did by the direction of the Spirit of God, he opened the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           </gap>uch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.30.35. And the Apoſtle tells us, that Chriſt <hi>gave ſome Apostles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtort and Teachers,</hi> Epheſ. 4.11. and therefore this office of teaching the people was not meerly Leviticall, and to be aboliſhed by Chriſt; we ſee the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, doth plainly witneſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Reward and wages for <hi>Levi</hi>'s ſervice was not ceremonial, but Moral, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of God and Nature; not to end in Chriſt, or at Chriſt's coming, but to continue to God to his Miniſter, laborers, and Servants for their labor in the work of the Goſpel unto the end of the world; for Chriſt himſelf appointed wages for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Miniſters, and this not of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Alms, at mens pleaſure whether they will pay or not, but of due debt for their labor: When he ſent them to preach the Goſpel, he gave them direction to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect wages and maintenance from them to whom he ſends them, <hi>Provide</hi> (ſaith he)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170725:34"/>
                           <hi>neither gold, nor ſilver, nor braſs in your purſes, neither ſcrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither ſhooes, nor yet ſtaves; for the workman is worthy of his meat,</hi> Mat. 10.
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.11</note> and <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.7. <hi>for the laborer is worthy of his hire,</hi> or reward, it is due to him, and the people to whom he preacheth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are bound by the Law of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to pay him for his labor. And hence the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.14.</note> 
                           <hi>Chriſt hath ordained that thoſe that preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> of their due reward and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for their labor in preaching the Goſpel. <hi>And the Elders that tule well</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are worthy of double honor,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.17, 18.</note> 
                           <hi>eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they that labor in the word and doctrine.</hi> And he gives the reaſon from the Law of God and Nature, <hi>For the Scripture ſaith thou ſhalt not muſſel the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the corn; and the laborer is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his reward.</hi> Therefore maintenance of Miniſters was not Levitical, but Moral, as wages and reward for their labor, as all other mens labor is and will be to the end of the world.</p>

<note place="margin">Judicial were the Givil laws of the Jews Lev. 17.30, &amp;c. Tythes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lord.</note> The Tythes which were given to <hi>Levi</hi> for his ſervice, were not Levitical, ceremonial, nor typical, nor Judicial, which were the Jews Civil Laws, whatſoever the Quakers or Anabaptiſts or any other have dreamed to the contrary; no holy things are Judicial, but Tythes were holy things; and Tythes were not ſhadows, and figures of holy things, not ceremonies to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Chriſt, but the Lords own por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declared to be Gods part, in every mans eſtate, long before <hi>Levi</hi> or the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law was inſtituted, though given to the <hi>Levites</hi> by Gods appointment for their ſervice during the life of that Prieſthood, and Gods part ſtill, Chriſt's inheritance, and the inheritance of his Miniſters to the worlds end, for there is a mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in them, and they are Gods part, for which he will call men to a reckoning at the great day of Judgement, when all the ſacrilegious wretches in the world ſhall tremble, except God in time give them to ſee their ſin and repent: For although <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi>'s Prieſthood be dead,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> yet Chriſt liveth who receiveth Tythes (as the Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes)
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170725:35"/>and Chriſt's Miniſters live and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Tythe, not by any right from <hi>Levi</hi> or <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Prieſthood, but from Chriſt <hi>who is a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec.</hi> That Tythes were ceremonial, was an opinion deviſed by <hi>Alexander de Hales</hi> an Engliſhman,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in his Tythes examined, and divine right pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, fol. 20</note> who lived about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt, as that learned Dr. <hi>Carleton</hi> well obſerves, and this indeed to pleaſe the Pope, that he might better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Tythes to his Monaſteries, his Abbots, Monks and Fryars, as after we ſhall touch. A ceremony is well deſcribed to be a carnal type of a holy thing, which for the ſervice of the Tabernacle was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned only until the time of Reformation, as the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10 holds them forth unto us; but Tythes are no ſuch ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they have a morality in them, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever arguments may be brought againſt the morality and perpetuity of Tythes, the ſame may be brought againſt the morality and continuance of the Sabath or Lords Day, as that learned, acute and ſolid Dr. <hi>Sclater</hi> in his ſevenfold parallel of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the morality of Tything,

                           <hi>God is always
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170725:42"/>ready to give his bleſſings, but the perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man oppoſeth; for he would have God give him all things, and he will offer unto God nothing of that whereof God himſelf is the owner.

Yet becauſe Almighty God doth merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully feed us, he beſtoweth upon the labourer a moſt liberal reward for his pains; he giveth him nine parts, and reſerveth only the tenth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, for his ſervice and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his ſervants.</hi> And I may add to this, What is it but baſe ingratitude, yea, flat robbery and ſacriledge, to deny God the tenth, or that the tenth is due to Chriſt and his Miniſters by Divine right? ſince God ſo freely giveth the nine parts, and reſerveth only the tenth for himſelf, whatſoever the Quakers or Anabaptiſts dare deny. Thus you have St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s judgement, that Tythes are Gods, and ſo due to Chriſt and his Miniſters by Divine right; and this was two hundred years before the Pope or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt of <hi>Rome</hi> was born.</p>

                        <p>But theſe men blinded by the ſpirit of Error, ſpeak they know not what: For what are Ceremonies, but carnal rites, which were enjoyned until the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as you may read <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. noted

Now Tythes were not appointed to teach men any thing, but for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and livelihood of them that are Teachers, the faithful Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Miniſters of Chriſt. Therefore Tythes are not ceremonies, as the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Quakers would have them; but the juſt Temporal outward gain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their labor, which the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt may lawfully ſeek by every man for his labor in his place.

Then brought all</hi> Judah <hi>the Tythe of the Corn, and new Wine and Oyl into the Treaſuries.</hi> This was the ſecond Tythe which was to be eaten before the Lord, and of which the Levites were to have part; and when that was kept from them, they fled every man to his field, to his quarter, where they had their houſes, and where they taught the people, and where they had the firſt Tythe to maintain them.</p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:170725:48"/>
                        <p>It was lawful for them in that caſe to ſeek every man for his gain from his place; and ſo it is now for the Miniſters of Chriſt, when their juſt dues are kept from them, they are conſtrained ſometimes to ſeek (though ſore againſt their will) every man for his juſt gain in his place where God ſets him.</p>
                        <p>And this they may lawfully do, yea, to deſire the help of the Magiſtrate, if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be obtained, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt blame, whatſoever Quakers or Anabaptiſts teach their Auditors.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have ſufficiently anſwered the Objections, pretending, that Tythes are Popiſh, Antichriſtian, and Ceremonial, and cleared the contrary at full, if men will not hoodwink themſelves, or be wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the deceivers.</p>

                              <hi>Mr. Selden in his. Hiſt. of Tythes. pag.</hi> 49.</note> 
                           <hi>Selden</hi> in his Hiſtory of Tythes tells us, that a perpetual Right of Tythes was conſecrated to ſome Churches by grant or aſſignment out of ſuch and ſuch lands at the owners pleaſure; that is, as he intends it, as voluntary contributions; (this was his new opinion.) But here I cannot but demand, upon what ground was this done? or what was the cauſe that moved theſe good religious men inſtructed in the faith of Chriſt, to conſecrate their Tythes, the tenth part of their increaſe, to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Miniſters of Chriſt? or to what end did they do this? And certainly, if we conſult their donations and declarations of their minds, (if we had them written at large) they would witneſs that they did conſecrate their Tythes, as being convinced in conſcience they are Gods due and Chriſts
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170725:50"/>right for the maintenance of his faithful Miniſters, who are careful and painful in preaching the Goſpel of Chriſt; not out of any wrong ground or ſuperſtitious end, as a will-worſhip. And therefore the taking them away from God, and the right uſe and end the Donor gave them, what can it be leſs then the ſin of ſacrilege.</p>
                        <p>And upon this ground and reaſon I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was the gift of King <hi>Lucius,</hi>

                        <p>This I cannot obſerve but with ſorrow, That the Parliament then conſented to King <hi>Henries</hi> Sacriledge, hoping it ſeems, that Tythes and Glebe-Lands would have been better beſtowed; but they being once in the Kings hands, to prevent a reſtitution, he diſtributes them to the Laity;

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170725:56"/>robbing God and his Miniſters of what is due to them. I am ſure, the cuſtom of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this reſpect, hath taken away the conſcience of ſin. I ſhould have been glad to have read, that the Reigns of King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charls,</hi> and the Parliaments in both their times, had drawn no guilt upon them by neglecting Reformation in theſe, as well as in other things.</p>
                        <p>I am ſure, one horrid act of Sacrilege was committed in the late Kings days by the plotting and power of the late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> charged againſt him in the ſixth Additional Article by the Houſe of Commons then aſſembled in Parliament; That whereas divers godly people, who were truly accounted good old Puritans, out of conſcience and perſwaſion that Tythes were due to God for his worſhip and ſervice, and they were ſacrilegiouſly taken away from the faithful Miniſters of particular Pariſhes, they endeavored by all good means the redeeming of them; yea ſome religious Noble-minded men did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give and reſtore Impropriations of great value to the Church again, and others gave great ſums of money towards the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them,

                        <p>And this I know was done in divers places, which would in a ſhort time have redeemed all the Impropriations in the land if it had been continued, and have been a means to have ſetled a ſufficient Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and an able godly Miniſter in every Congregation. But by the late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his project deſtroyed, leſt (as was pretended) Puritan Miniſters ſhould fill the places.

                        <p>Friends, I deſire you to conſider what is profeſſed by them in the Fifty eighth Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That it is the good pleaſure of God which hath given gifts of his grace to the Saints or Church of God, that ſome of the gifted men ſhould be appointed or ſet apart to attend upon the preaching of the Word, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>And Section Fifty nine,

                           <hi>That it is the will of God, that thoſe which are appointed ſo to ſpend their labors in teaching or exhorting in the knowledge of God to their edification, and conſolation, ought to have maintenance of thoſe that receive ſpiritual food by them.</hi>

                        <p>You ſay, <hi>They ought to have maintenance;</hi> certainly, then it is the peoples duty to maintain them, by your own confeſſion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe how can you ſay they ought to have maintenance? And if they ought to have maintenance, why not Tythes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God himſelf, and approved both before and ſince the coming of Chriſt, and in the Church of God, yea, by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (as I have proved at large) as well as any other maintenance of Charity or Alms, as you or they would pretend in their next Section? And if they be appointed or ſet apart to attend upon the preaching of the word (as they ſay in the Fifty eighth Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) Then how ought they to labor with their hands, that they may not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeable, as they ſay in Section Sixty, and for which they alleadge 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12.

                        <p>This they ſeem to bring in by head and

Verſe 6, 7. you might have learned that both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> had power to forbear working. It was not any Ordinance of Chriſt, that they or any other Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould work with their hands to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves or get a livelihood, but that they that preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel, as the Apoſtle teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.18. I let paſs divers Errors in that Declaration of their Faith, too long to trouble the Reader with. I ſhall conclude this with prayer to God, that the Lord would open the eyes both of you and them, to ſee your error and ſin in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from, or at leaſt, continuing your forſaking of our Reformed and Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Congregations, making Rents and Schiſms in the Churches of Chriſt, and giving advantage to the common enemy to deſtroy the godly party, either amongſt us or your ſelves: For although you are too full of error, yet I dare not think but ſome who are not ſatisfied with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Infant Baptiſm, may yet be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, though ſick with error, and ſuch as ſtand in great need of healing by the Sun of Righteouſneſs, who will ariſe to them that fear his name, with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p>Now I aſſume, but tythes are abſolutely due by the law of God, as I have proved at full from the holy Scriptures, beſides multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of teſtimonies witneſſing the divine right, both in antient times, and at this day.</p>
                        <p>Therefore no cuſtome, uſage, preſcription, or Popiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſpenſation can acquit from payment of the utmoſt penny of the tenth part; this concluſion neceſſarily followeth from <hi>Anthony Peirſon</hi>'s premiſes.</p>
                        <p>And then firſt, all preſcriptions, compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cuſtoms for payment of leſs than the tenth part, are utterly unlawful, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſuch tythes muſt needs be ſacriledg for to take or keep away that which is Gods, and belongeth to Chriſt, and to his Miniſters and Ambaſſadors, is a robbing of God, and ſacriledg, againſt which the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi>
                           <pb n="118" facs="tcp:170725:72"/>proclaimed a curſe,
<note place="margin">Mat. 3.6, 7.</note> and promiſeth a bleſſing to the reſtorers of them It is a lamentable thing that Lay men ſhould receive the tythes, and the people maintain their Miniſters to teach (if they will have any.)</p>
                        <p>Again, if the Tythes be Gods reſerved part, and belong to the Miniſters of Chriſt who preach the Goſpel to the people, by Divine right (as we have proved out of the Word of God ſufficiently) then as <hi>Anthony Peirſon</hi> confeſſeth, the Popes diſpenſation, or acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any Lands from payment of tythes, was utterly unlawful and ſacrilegious, as was all his improper Appropriation, or tythes to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, Monaſteries, or any ſuch popiſh inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſacrilegious alſo certainly it was; and was not King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight his taking and ſelling of tythes from the Church ſacriledge alſo? certainly it muſt needs follow, it was a robbing of God, and of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, and ſo ſacriledge: and then is it not ſacriledge in them that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them? this God hath witneſſed by many examples, his wrath againſt ſuch as detain them from the faithful Preachers of the Goſpel, as I have declared in my <hi>Juſtification of Miniſters maintenance by tythes,</hi> and as might be proved, by many ſad examples of Gods judgements againſt Sacriledge, both in this and other Nations, therefore it is very good all the Impropriators ſhould part from them, yea upon reaſonable conſiderations, ſince many bought them as <hi>Anthony Peirſon</hi> intimates, for little or nothing; but it is not that tythes ſhould be taken away from the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170725:72"/>faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, but reſtored to them as their juſt due, both by the law of God, and the moſt antient laws of the Land.

                  <p>If you read <hi>Numb.</hi> 34.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was commanded to be divided by Lot; and <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.2, 3.4. the Lord commands the Children of <hi>Iſrael, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their poſſeſsion Cities to dwell in, and ſhall give alſo for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites ſuburbs for the Citysround about them, and their Cities ſhall they have to dwell in,

                           <hi>Therefore here we do deteſt the errour of the Anabaptiſts, who are not content with one only Baptiſm, and that once received, but do alſo condemn the Baptiſm of Infants, yea of thoſe that be born of faithful Parents</hi> Thus the Reformed Churches in <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Confeſſion.

And whatſoever is written to the contrary, either by your chief Teachers, or by other your miſerable, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſcribling later Pamphlets, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready anſwered or replyed unto by ſuch Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, Learned and Godly men before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and others of our Judgment, and that with ſufficient Scripture-proof, and full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences from the voice of the Spirit of God ſpeaking in the holy Scriptures, far better than your falſe and non following conſequences,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170725:80"/>you have brought againſt Infant Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm, although you find fault with us for conſequences. Read your beſt Teachers, and ſee if you can find one proof or ſhew of proof againſt Infant-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip of Believers children, or their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, without a Conſequence or Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>This is the proof of your writers againſt it by conſequences. Read Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Haggar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goſnold,</hi> and the reſt. And if you uſe conſequences againſt Infant-Baptiſm, and conſequences which will not follow, why may not we uſe conſequences to prove the lawfulneſſe of Infant-Baptiſm?
<note place="margin">Pr. <hi>by J. S.</hi> 1657.</note> Read your late friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Goſnold</hi> (as honeſt and learned as any of you) his diſcourſe of the Baptiſm of water and of the Spirit, read his firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prove a Truth, That water-Baptiſm is to continue, he proveth by a conſequence. That which was once commanded by Jeſus Chriſt, and never repealed by him, is ſtill in force and to continue, but water Baptiſm was once commanded by Chriſt and never repealed by him, therefore it is ſtill in force and to continue. Thus I may argue againſt you for Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>That which was once commanded by Chriſt, and never repealed by him is ſtill in force and to continue. But an outward ſign and ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, and priviledge of Church memberſhip was once commanded by Chriſt and appointed for Believers and their infant-children,

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170725:80"/>repealed by Chriſt; Therefore a ſign and ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of Faith, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Church-memberſhip is ſtill to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to Believers and their children: And if children muſt have the ſame ſign with their Parents, then what but Baptiſm; but you caſt off our conſequences, though you make bold with them your ſelves. I urged this argument twelve years ſince, therefore I leave it off.</p>
                        <p>Again read <hi>John Goſnold</hi> his ſecond Chapter, where he labours to prove the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Baptizing, that it was by dipping the whole body in water, his ſeeming proof is by conſequence.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From mens teſtimony.</p>
                        <p>And 2. From the nature of the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to dip, though the word doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie to dip, and no Scripture ſaith that they did dip the whole body in water. And if they had, yet a circumſtance in Baptiſm may as lawfully be changed, as the time of celebration of the Lords Supper was changed, which was a circumſtance.</p>
                        <p>Read his third Chapter, in which if he could, he would prove the ſubjects of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be grown perſons, fitly qualified, and not Infants. His ſeeming proofs are by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, and falſe conſequences too, like thoſe it ſeems you borrowed of him; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe qualifications for Baptiſm, all which are only requiſite in men and women of ripe years, not of Infant-children of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to admit them to an Infant-memberſhip in the Church. And what are his arguments

Certain it is the deſign of the ſubtil Jeſuite carried on by Quakers, ſome Anabaptiſts, and Familiſts to cry down Univerſities, Humane Learning and Miniſters, that they might more eaſily bring us back to the bondage of Popery, blind Superſtition, and antichriſtian Tyranny. And too many weak ſouls without queſtion are in this the ſervants of antichriſt ignorantly;
<note place="margin">Job 42.6</note> which if they underſtood what they did, would bewail their ignorance, and repent in duſt and aſhes. But for Humane Learning, we do not make that to be the foundation either of our Church or Miniſtry, as you falſly accuſe us; but the Word of God, and the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Chriſt himſelf being the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone, upon which the Church is builded. Witneſſe Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17, 18. and the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 2.20. Yet we may tell you it is lawful for us to make uſe of Humane Learning, and it is neceſſary for us,

I will eaſily grant that if you had been trained up in the Univerſities, and had as much Learning Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and as much Grace and natural parts and gifts of God, as Gods faithful Miniſters have, you might preach as well as we, and as lawfully too, if you had as lawful a Call and Ordination to the miniſterial Office, and therefore whatſoever high thoughts you have of your ſelves, you are but meer intruders and furtherers of the Kingdom of antichriſt, &amp; of errours,

                           <hi>Friends:</hi> I ſee you are very forgetful of what you boaſted of in the firſt page of your ſheet of paper, That your <hi>Foundation Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> (for as I underſtand you, it is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of your own Church you ſpeak of) if you account your ſelves &amp; your company a Church of God, <hi>That theſe your Foundation Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have Scripture as clear to prove them, as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170725:89"/>the Sun at noon-day, withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, you ſpeak magiſterially againſt Infant-memberſhip, and accuſe us as if our Church were builded only of theſe, but you prove it not, and your places of Scripture are all conſequences; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo for your Second, your places of Scripture are all falſely applyed, they may belong rather to your ſelves than to us. And for your Third, which conſiſts of your Friend <hi>Haggars</hi> four legs, which you call <hi>Sandy Pillars,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Foundations,</hi> if any ſhew of proof could have been, it muſt have been by conſequences, of which here you bring none, and ſo have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof, nor ſhew of proof: ſo that I may juſtly tell you what you had writ in your Paper, is not ſufficient to convince me, or any rational man in the world of the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Grounds and Reaſons of your ſeparation from our Aſſemblies.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I hope if God be pleaſed to open your eyes to ſee your Errors, you will in Gods due time return to us again, I do not mean to joyn with thoſe Congregations, or Aſſemblies which are neither Reformed, nor Reforming, who take no care to ſeparate the pretious from the vile,

                        <p>But I conclude with my humble and hearty Prayers to our good God in Jeſus Chriſt, that it will pleaſe him to open your hearts to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to the Doctrines of men, or humane Tradition, which they call New lights, but upon true examination will be found old E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. It is a practice whereby men do aſſume to themſelves that which is peculiar unto God, <hi>viz.</hi> Judgement concerning future events either concerning Kingdoms or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it draws the heart of men from God the Father, and Chriſt his Son, from conſidering the VVorks of the one, &amp; heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the words of the other, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.8, 18, 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 16.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe it nouriſheth vain and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hopes and fears, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.2.</p>
                  <p>All which Conſiderations publiſhed, are to this end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As an alarum, that the Conſciences of thoſe that ſtudy it may be awakened, that they may be fully convinced of the great evill that is in it, that abhorring ſuch an abominable evill that is ſo hateful to God, and a reall trouble to the Conſciences of good men; by leaving the ſin, they may avoid the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Conſcientious Magiſtrates may know how nearly it concerns them to do their duties, in vindicating the Glory of God, by putting a period to the ſtudy of Judicial Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, a practiſe indeed that brings the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God into ſo much contempt in the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, That all thoſe that have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to learn it, and thoſe who enquire of Aſtrologers what good or ill Fortune (as they term it) ſhall happen to them in the courſe of their lives, may through Gods Grace ſtifle ſuch unlawful deſires; all which through the Grace of God ſhall be the prayers and ſupplications of him (put up in the name of the Lord Jeſus) who is their friend to his power,</p>
